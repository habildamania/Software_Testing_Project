# Software_Testing_Project
This repository is for the Software Testing Project implemented as part of our coursework for the CS 6367.001 class at University of Texas at Dallas

# PS: This repository is new because we didn't maintain a github repository during our software development life cycle. However, per Dr. Zhang's instructions in the latest email asking everyone to maintain a repo and upload contributions on git, we have created this repository.
